# Cutomer lifetime value (CLV)
Customer lifetime value (CLV) is one of the key stats to track as part of a customer experience program. Customer lifetime value is a measurement of how valuable a customer is to your company, not just on a purchase-by-purchase basis but across entire customer relationships.
## Return purchase by cohort
We want to ensure that existing customers are making repeat purchases. How many customers take one, two, three, N quarters to make a repeat purchase? How many have never made a repeat purchase? What does this behavior look like broken out by quarterly cohorts? We can use a FIXED Expression to find the first and second purchase dates per customer, and derive the number of quarters to make a repeat purchase from this.
